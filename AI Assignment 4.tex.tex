\textbf{"Biodynamics is a scientifically sound approach to sustainable management of plant system"}




{\textbf{Introduction}}:\subparagraph{
} Biodynamic agriculture is the method of organic forming that treats farms as united and separate organisms.The calender used by biodynamics has been described as \textbf{astrological}. Biodynamicists chemical and compost have been classified as unconventional and homeopathic. There is no empirical evidence that certified biodynamic agriculture technique differ from equivalent organic and integrated farming approaches in terms of favourable effects. \\ Because of its over reliance on \textbf{esoteric knowledge and mystical ideas} biodynamic labeled as \textbf{pseudoscience}.\\



\textbf{The Myth}: \subparagraph{}
Biodynamic agriculture is a method of agriculture management based on\textbf{ Rudolf Steiner's} lectures from 1924.Dr. Steiner become increasingly worried about the degradation of food generated by forming practices that increasingly relied on the addition of chemicals , pesticides and inorganic fertilisers.\\ Biodynamic has grown over tha last century to incorporate various organic farming approaches with demonstrable benefits on land uses and crop output. In both science and popular literature , biodynamic is frequently used interchangeably with organic. \\ Biodynamic agriculture is more well known in Europe , but its supporters in north america are growing . is the biodynamic way of thinking one that should be promoted?\\




 1. Biodynamic agriculture began as mystical , and thus unscientific, alternative to conventional agriculture.\\
 2. Biodynamics has recently included organic technique, resulting in a blending of objective practices with sujective beliefs.\\
 3.Biodynamic preparations have received limited scientific testing , and there is no evidence that adding them to originally maintained landscape enhances plant or soil quality.\\
 4. Many organic measures have been scientifically proven to soil and plant health parameters.
 \paragraph{}\textbf{Uses of Artificial Intelligence In Agriculture}
 \\1. With the implementation of agricultural AI, farmers can analyze weather conditions, temperature, water uses and soil conditions  collected from their farm to make informed decisions on business choices.
 \\2. AI combined with unnamed aircraft system and drones can capture images of the entire farm and analyze them in near real time  monitoring and analyzing soil health and condition of crops across the entire farm , as well as identifying problem areas.
 \\3.using AI system to improve harvest quality and accuracy is a management style known as precision agriculture. using this technique we detect diseases in plant , pests and poor plant nutrition on farms. AI sensors can detect and target weeds while deciding which herbicides to apply within the right buffer overapplication of herbicides and herbicide resistance.
 \\4. AI are wonderful tools for reducing error in business process , and farmers are tanking advantages of forcasting and predictive analysis to reduce the risk of crop failures. \\
 5. AI can solve critical farm labor challenges by removing works and reducing the need for large numbers of workers. with the help of AI bots.
